# Unified Wallet Kit With Telegram Integration Backend

This repository offers a sample backend implementation for [Unified Wallet Kit With Telegram Integration](https://github.com/jychab/Unified-Wallet-Kit-With-Telegram).

It utilizes Firebase as the database to securely store and handle signing with users' private keys.

Things to note:
- In a production environment, it's crucial to encrypt private keys at rest. We recommend using a Key Management Service (KMS) such as [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-key-management) to ensure robust protection of sensitive data.
